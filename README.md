# Micro.blog web browser extension

This simple extension adds a button to Firefox or Chrome to make it easier to bookmark the current web page.

It has been submitted to the Firefox and Chrome web extension stores. It can also be installed manually in those browsers.

Safari support will follow later, as part of Micro.blog for macOS.
